# Building AI Apps with Node.js

This repository contains code for apps that explore various applications of artificial intelligence (AI). The project focuses on building command-line tools that leverage AI functionalities from OpenAI and Gemini.

The course [OpenAI with Node.js](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/openai-node) from Frontend Masters covers fundamental concepts such as word embeddings, vector stores, and semantic search. Additionally, real-world applications have been built, including:

- **Semantic Search Engine:** A search experience that understands the meaning of queries beyond keyword matching.
- **Document Question Answering (QA):** Extraction of factual information from a knowledge base by asking questions in natural language.
- **Function Calling with AI:** Exploration of how AI can interact with external systems by calling functions, with a focus on responsible development.

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Gain a practical understanding of core AI concepts.
- Build foundational skills in text embeddings, vector stores, and semantic search.
- Develop real-world AI applications.
- Learn best practices for deploying AI models in production.
- Emphasize the transition from development to production.
- highlighting the scaling challenges one might encounter.
